# Langchain_App
Welcome to the Introduction to LangChain repository! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of LangChain, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs).

LangChain is a versatile library that enables developers to create sophisticated applications using LLMs like OpenAI's GPT, Cohere, and more. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that simplify the integration of LLMs into various applications, from chatbots to content generation systems.

Do not forget to use your own openai key when using the codes!
